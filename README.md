## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis and visualization of Blinkit's grocery sales dataset. The goal is to uncover insights around sales, customer preferences, and outlet performance to guide strategic business decisions for India's quick-commerce grocery delivery platform — Blinkit.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Blinkit operates across various cities with different outlet types, sizes, and product categories. However, it lacks a consolidated view of:
- What drives the highest sales?
- Which outlets or cities are more profitable?
- What customers prefer in terms of products and ratings?

This analysis aims to solve that by building an insightful dashboard and providing actionable recommendations.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

1. Analyze overall performance using key KPIs like Total Sales, Average Sales, and Average Rating.
2. Understand product performance across different categories.
3. Compare outlet size, type, and tier performance.
4. Study customer preferences via item ratings, fat content, and item visibility.
5. Provide business recommendations based on data.
